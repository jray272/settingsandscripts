settingsandscripts
==================

Application settings and scripts that I want to be able to get whenever I startup a new machine.

Right now this doesn't have much, but I would like to be able to accumulate various settings and scripts as I go along.

The type of things you can find in here:
.files - (.emacs, .bashrc etc)
productivity scripts
file manipulation scripts
anything else I find useful
